We’re outside the Dome talking Syracuse men’s lacrosse 2013—what defined that season for you?
A strong run into the title game built on efficient offense and key possessions, though turnovers hurt late.
Which single metric worried you most?
Clearing under pressure; opponents forced extra possessions and our late-game shot quality dipped.
If you were coaching, what’s the first change?
More structured man-up sets, earlier middie rotations to keep legs fresh, and sharper ground-ball work.
What’s a realistic outlook next season?
With better clears and possession discipline, a top-3 finish and another deep postseason run are realistic.
That’s our quick hit from campus—back to you!
